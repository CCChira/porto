Personal Presentation website, built with NextJS + Typescript, Tailwind, and soon Redux/ReduxToolkit

Step 1
-> Relearning React. Querying TMDB database to make a search display of movies.

Step 2
-> Delving deeper in prop-drilling and state managing without an external tool.
-> Building a functional Wordle app, due to being unable to find an appropriate API, I just scraped all english 5 letter words and added them as constants

Step 3 - plans
-> Adding Firebase + Redux toolkit. Firebase for auth/db issues, Redux for moving the App state to a global store and avoid prop drilling
