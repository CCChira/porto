Personal Presentation website, built with NextJS + Typescript, Tailwind, and soon Redux/ReduxToolkit

Step 1
-> Relearning React. Querying TMDB database to make a search display of movies. :white_check_mark: (needs polishing, got bored of it)

Step 2
-> Delving deeper in prop-drilling and state managing without an external tool.
-> Building a functional Wordle app, due to being unable to find an appropriate API, I just scraped all english 5 letter words and added them as constants
 (game loop is polished, still need to add leaderboard and statistics) :white_check_mark:

Step 3
-> Adding Firebase + Redux toolkit. Firebase for auth/db issues, Redux for moving the App state to a global store and avoid prop drilling :heavy_check_mark:

Step 4 -> plans 
-> Using Firebase and Redux -> Create statistics/leaderboards per users.

Step 5 -> plans
-> Create some sort of websockets in order to create a multiplayer blackjack game
